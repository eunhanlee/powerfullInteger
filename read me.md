## **Problem Solving Approach**

1. Traverse through all the numbers in the intervals and store their frequencies in a HashMap.
2. Sort the hashmap based on the keys.â†’in worst case, O(n log n)
3. Find the maximum powerful integer by iterating through the sorted hashmap, which occurs at least k times.

## **Time Complexity: O(n log n), Space Complexity: O(n)**

```java
import java.util.*;
class Solution {

    /**
     * This method takes in the number of intervals n, the 2D integer array of intervals interval, 
     * and the minimum number of occurrences k for a number to be considered powerful.
     * It returns the powerful integer which occurs at least k times. If multiple integers have 
     * at least k occurrences, the maximum integer out of all those elements is returned.
     * If no integer occurs at least k times, -1 is returned.
     *
     * @param n         the number of intervals
     * @param interval  the 2D integer array of intervals where interval[i] = [start, end]
     * @param k         the minimum number of occurrences for a number to be considered powerful
     * @return the powerful integer which occurs at least k times, or -1 if no integer occurs at least k times
